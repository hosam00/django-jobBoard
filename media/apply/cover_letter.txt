Hello, my friend
I hope you are well.

It is exciting that you looking forward to extracting data from some auto parts sites.
but there is a question I need to ask
What do you mean by "skus"?

I understand that finding the right fit for your project is a top priority.
Getting the right time for delivery is critical to you.
I'm available to start working immediately

with 1 year of experience in web scraping, I have worked with clients just like you on many similar projects.
For instance, I had scraped Amazon, eBay...etc.
This gives me just the right experience and perspective that you are looking for.

I have attached some samples for you to review it and if you could send me the link of the website you want to scrape
that will help me understand how the site work and what is the best technology I will use
In addition, I want to make a sample of the data you want to see it first and if you have any comments I will be more than happy
to fix it and start working with you
I would be happy to discuss your project needs and how I can help you meet them

I look forward to talking to you
